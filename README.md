#  LittleChat

So I decided to start a small chat app for iOS

Why?
--

Well, this app will work with a simple login and account creation systems with Firebase. I realised that none of my apps on Github had anything like that, so I wanted to give it a try

So I decided to simplify stuff for now

Requirements:
--

- App will have a create account scene
- App will have a login scene
- App will allow user to share messages with users from the database
